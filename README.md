Fitster is a mini project that I have created using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
It is a fitness calculator that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Relative Fat Mass (RFM) of a person.
The Body Mass Index (BMI) estimates body fitness based on the height and weight measurements of a person whereas the Relative Fat Mass (RFM) index estimates body fat percentage based on the ratio of height and waist measurements of a person. 
It is a simple and accurate calculator that can be used just by providing the necessary informations.
